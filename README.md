# BB-8 Sphero using Node.js
***
I was super lucky to receive BB-8 as a birthday gift and as soon as I learned that BB-8 Sphero was hackable, I dived straight into looking up just how to do it.

After a few hours of googling, I narrowed down my search to these two resources, which I found to be awesomely useful.

- [Sphero.js](https://github.com/orbotix/sphero.js)
- [Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/documentation/drivers/bb8/)

Being new to programming, it took me a good hour to get BB-8 connected but it was definitely worth it.

For now, BB-8 behaves like a RC Car, but hey at least I get to randomise it's colours and move it around using my laptop.
