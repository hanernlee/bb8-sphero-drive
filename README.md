# BB-8 Sphero
***
I was fortunate enough to receive a Star Wars BB-8 Sphero as a birthday gift and as soon as I learned that BB-8 Sphero was hackable, I dived straight into looking for documentation.

After a few hours of googling, I narrowed down my search to these two resources, which I found to be awesomely useful.

- [Sphero.js](https://github.com/orbotix/sphero.js)
- [Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/documentation/drivers/bb8/)

Being new to programgming, it took me a good hour and a half to get BB-8 connected through Node.js, but it was definitely worth it once I got it working.

For now, this cute droid behaves like a RC Car, but hey at least I get to move it around using my laptop and randomise BB-8's colours.
